## üê± Hi!

I am Flori, 20 years old, trans\*, non-binary and a computer science student. I like solving my own daily annoyances and problems using code, and solving other peoples' annoyances and problems using code as well! I am currently working on [the Polyphony Project](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/) ^^

## üß© Projects
  
  A little overview of projects which I have created, or am a maintainer of.

### Polyphony
  
  [Polyphony](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/) is supposed to be an all-in-one organization for a self-hosted, Discord-like chat service. It is based upon the [Spacebar](https://github.com/spacebarchat) protocol, which is a 1:1 re-implementation of the Discord API,
  and backwards compatible with Discord.com. The entire project is written in safe and efficient Rust.
  
### magicaltavern
  
  The [magicaltavern-server](https://github.com/nerdsplayingpnp-tud/magicaltavern-web) and a [client in the form of a Discord bot](https://github.com/nerdsplayingpnp-tud/magicaltavern-discord) are two projects of mine, which I have created to organize a Pen and Paper
  community which I am a part of. This community I've mentioned is accessible for all enrolled students of the university I am studying at, and is hosting Pen and Paper/Dungeons and Dragons campaigns for everyone who'd like to participate! The projects facilitate
  the organization of the entire thing. TL;DR: The server is a big database behind a self-implemented REST-API, which stores all the information about the currently running campaigns and the people which are enrolled in them. The client is, well, a client! :)

## üí° About this profile

This is my personal GitHub Profile. If you look around, you will almost certainly find some empty repositories. This is because I treat my GitHub Repositories as "Bookmarks" for Ideas that I eventually want to turn into code.
