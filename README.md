### 🐱 Hi!

I am Flori, 20 years old, trans\*, non-binary and a computer science student. I like solving my own daily annoyances and problems using code, and solving other peoples' annoyances and problems using code as well! I am currently working on [the Polyphony Project](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/) ^^

### 💡 About this profile

This is my personal GitHub Profile. If you look around, you will almost certainly find some empty repositories. This is because I treat my GitHub Repositories as "Bookmarks" for Ideas that I eventually want to turn into code.
