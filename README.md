![A screenshot of computer code, written in the Rust programming language. The code defines several variables, including contact email addresses, public key fingerprints, and pronouns. It also defines a structure named "Flori" with fields for name, age, pronouns, and biography. The code then creates an instance of the "Flori" structure and prints information about it, including contact details and a biography that says:"Hi! I am Flori. I'm a 21 year old, passionate Software Engineer, currently working for the Deutsche Telekom MMS GmbH. Education-wise, I'm in the process of getting my bachelors degree in Computer Science. I dedicate a lot of my free time to working on the Polyphony project, which, when released, will provide decentralized, federated and secure communications software, aimed primarily to be a replacement to Discord."](./assets/code.png)
